### Configuring the VPN on MacOS

1. Go to [EDRNet Portal](https://vpn.edrnet.com) and log in by using your Active Directory (AD) credentials. The initial portion of your email defines your AD credentials before the **@lightboxre.com**. For example, if your email is `mpolo@lightboxre.com`, your AD username is `mpolo`. Your AD password is the same as your email account.
2. After login, download the VPN client by pressing the "Download for [OS]" button, where [OS] will be your current Operative System.
3. Open and install the downloaded installation file. Be aware you need Administration permissions to be able to install this tool.
4. After the installation, you need to enable the permissions to allow the App to open by accessing your Security and Privacy Settings. You can access this option in: `Settings > Security and Privacy`. Click on the Lock to unlock the settings. After opening the settings, click the "Allow" option in the "Allow apps downloaded from". This option removes the system restriction to allow the Cisco Client to be open. This action requires restarting your computer.
5. After restarting, open the Cisco Client, set the URL `vpn.edrnet.com` in the required field, and click connect.
6. After clicking **Connect**, you must use your Active Directory credentials to complete the connection.
