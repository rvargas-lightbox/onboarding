# A little big of context
This application has been used for more than XX years. During this time frame, this project has transformed several times and survived to different teams and business requirements. It's essential to understand that many of the technologies we have nowadays don't exist at that moment, and the application move based on the Customer's requirements and needs.

Please, be patient a try to understand this before making any judgment. This team comprises many outstanding professionals working hard to improve both the customer and development experience. We encourage good practices, optimization, and refactoring. Still, before you can go into that path, you must understand the magnitude and size of this project and the impact of any change on the application.

As a new developer, we understand you want to immediately jump to action and start with lasted technologies and top practices. We don't want to discourage you, but it's essential to understand this will be a slow process, but if you are patient, learn deep enough about how the tool is built, and do it right, you can help us to go into that path.
